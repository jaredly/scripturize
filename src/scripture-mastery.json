  "Moses 1:39": "For behold, this is my work and my gloryâ€”to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.",
  "Moses 7:18": "And the Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them.",
  "2 Nephi 9:51": "Wherefore, do not spend money for that which is of no worth, nor your labor for that which cannot satisfy. Hearken diligently unto me, and remember the words which I have spoken; and come unto the Holy One of Israel, and feast upon that which perisheth not, neither can be corrupted, and let your soul delight in fatness."
